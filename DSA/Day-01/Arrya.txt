What are Arrays? :
An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored at contiguous memory locations.
or
Arrays are ordered collections of elements (indexed from 0).

In Interviews:

Arrays are used in most problems (search, sort, sliding window, etc.).

Common Operations:

Operation	        Time Complexity
Access	               O(1)
Insert at end	       O(1)
Insert in middle	   O(n)
Search	               O(n)



Common Methods:
1️⃣ push(): Adds an element to the end.
Example:
let arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3); // [1, 2, 3]


2️⃣ pop(): Removes the last element.

Example:
arr.pop(); // [1, 2]
3️⃣ shift() / unshift()

shift() removes from start.

unshift() adds to start.

javascript
Copy code
arr.unshift(0); // [0, 1, 2]
arr.shift(); // [1, 2]
4️⃣ splice()

Remove or replace elements in place.

javascript
Copy code
arr.splice(1, 1); // Removes 1 element at index 1
Real-World Example
You fetch API data into an array of users.

You might map() to render them in React.

You might filter() to remove inactive users.

 Summary of Day 1
✅ JavaScript Topics:

What is ES6?

Why use let and const?

Differences from var

Real-world examples (config constants, counters)

Interview readiness

✅ DSA Arrays:

Definition & complexity

Basic operations

Common problems to solve:

Reverse array

Find max/min

Sum elements

Remove duplicates

Merge two arrays

✅ Development Purpose:

Use arrays to store lists of data in your apps.

Use let and const consistently in all modern JavaScript.

✅ Interview Purpose:

You will be asked about scoping (var vs let vs const) and basic array manipulations frequently.
