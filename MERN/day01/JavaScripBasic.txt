JavaScript ES6
 what is ES6 :- ES6 (ECAMCScript 2015 ) is major update to javaScript that introduced mordern syntax and features to make code cleaner ,modular and easier to maintain


✨ Why it matters:
-Development: Almost every modern project uses ES6 syntax (React, Node).

-Interviews: You will be asked about ES6 features like let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, etc.


🟢 let and const:-

1️⃣ let:
Used to declare block-scoped variables.

Can be reassigned, but not redeclared in the same scope.

Example:
let counter = 0;
counter = counter + 1; // ✅ Works fine

but in Block Scope:
{
  let name = "Alice";
}
console.log(name); // ❌ ReferenceError: name is not defined


🔹 Interview Tip:
What is the difference between var and let?
✅ var is function-scoped and hoisted.
✅ let is block-scoped and not initialized until declaration.



2️⃣ const
Declares block-scoped constants.

Must be initialized at declaration.

Cannot be reassigned, but object properties CAN be mutated.

Example:
const API_KEY = "abc123";
API_KEY = "def456"; // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

Mutating object:
const user = { name: "Alice" };
user.name = "Bob"; // ✅ This is allowed

🔹 Interview Tip:

Can you modify a const object?
✅ Yes, you can mutate properties.
✅ You cannot reassign the variable itself.


3️⃣ When to use?
Use const by default.

Use let if you expect to reassign.

Example in development:

const BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com";
let page = 1;
page = 2;
